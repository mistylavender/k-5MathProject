### Preparing for the Finish Line
Steve Jobs Founder of Apple Computer 2 minutes: [Thinker Doer](https://www.google.com/search?q=Steve+Jobs+Thinker+Doers&oq=Steve+Jobs+Thinker+Doers&aqs=chrome..69i57.16126j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#kpvalbx=_kTZKYoe0KoKckPIPlJWX-Aw20).   What is your takeaway?


Something happened to me last Thursday. I was tagged as having said something inappropriate.  This put me into a state of depression.  I even spent big portions of Friday crying, praying, listening to talks and soul searching.   As this process continued into the weekend I have learned that I can’t quit, linger in depression, or stay in self pity because of something that was said about me.  No matter how much it hurts me inside: Pity, anger, injustice feelings won't make it go away.


I have learned this weekend that just because I have tried to be good and dedicate a second career to others, this in itself does not entitle me to be isolated from criticism and dislike.  I am now willing to accept that internal pain and go forward with a renewed positive and spirited momentum.  I am comfortable in values I represent, in what I have said or not said.  I listened to a speaker who spoke about riding a bicycle, don't look back or at down to the peddles.  These behaviors only lead to worse things happening.  Instead,  look at the road ahead and enjoy the ride.


Students please remember that I have my faults!  These faults, perhaps, have contributed to a system that puts pressure on you as students.  A pressure that makes my students feel a need to copy versus do their own work, or attempt to place fault in me as a Teacher, or even represent that this Teacher is a root of certain students faults and problems.  I can see how you, as a student, might view me as a Teacher as an obstacle to get points and a grade.  I want you to ask your forgiveness if you think I am that person.

How prevalent is cheating at MIT? Answer (1 of 25)


I teach 6.854 Advanced Algorithms every fall at MIT. This is a graduate class although about 1/2 the students are undergrads. The class assessments are based entirely on weekly homework and final project; there are no exams. Many of my problems are recycled from previous years because they are the most effective problems for teaching the material. As with most classes at MIT, collaboration is strongly encouraged (and, for most students, necessary to complete the work). I begin the first lecture with a discussion of what kind of collaboration is acceptable (working on solving the problems together) and what is not (copying anyone’s work, or any solutions you find online — you have to write up your own thoughts). I’ve also, in recent years, put an “ethics” problem on the first problem set, which lists various scenarios and asks which ones violate the collaboration policy and why. Students always get this question right. And, I say what I say in the previous paragraph. But it doesn’t help.


Just about every year, we discover (exactly) one cheating incident where a student finds solutions online and copies them. I suspect it’s the only one, because it’s honestly pretty easy to notice when the student solution is just like the one I wrote. In general, the student admits what they’ve done as soon as they’re confronted, expresses remorse, and explains that it’s just because they were under so much pressure and the course is really hard.


The students’ excuses, sadly, are true. I don’t condone this behavior, and we always send these students up before the office of student conduct. But I do understand this behavior: MIT is a place which prizes academic achievement above everything, and when you’re not achieving you feel tremendous pressure to do something about it. It’s a shame, because when you take away this pressure (I see this between semesters) the students turn into brilliant and enthusiastic people who just love learning for its own sake. I wish we could detach the learning that they all love from the assessment that they all hate, but nobody has solved that problem yet.

I have similar policies to this MIT algorithm teacher.  No test, collaboration, ...  I am trying to find the master algorithm of motivation versus learning as well.  


I want you to remember my policies…
1. 50% for attending class and doing.  A ‘C’ grade for an entire trimester of doing nothing
2. A ‘B’ for any reasonable effort, that effort can be ON assignment or ON almost anything technical
3. An ‘A’ for consistently improving on assignments that are within my suggested task.  Ss I have stated a positive  slope.
4. An ‘A’ and recommendation for doing things beyond tasks or special service in classroom.  I believe you will know when you have reached this level.
5. Then finally, a zero if you copy, cheat, bear false witness of your own work, or bear false witness in crossover of another’s work.  IMO, picking this option has led to sorrow for many of us in recent weeks.


Though, these are just my policies.  Nothing is final and I am willing to give time, help, or advice on how to overcome obstacles.  In fact, it is part of a covenant I have made with God to live a life that honors my wife, family and others.  In that, as a family, we believe in serving each and every student as individuals.  My wife knows many of your stories and needs, as I consult with her often.  Additionally, with Ms Naidu now on staff we often speak of how to improve our CompSci teaching and how to help those that feel challenges or overwhelmed.  I have policies as mentioned, but I am not bound by these policies.  This year, I am adapting policies for many.  Particularly those that we have noticed or those that have advocated needs.


In my life, I have needed policy adaptations.  In 2004, my 1st wife became terminally ill and died.  At the time. I had a child in High School, Middle School, and Elementary.  The company had policies for work, policies for time, and expectations for performance.  I am grateful for the many friends and colleagues that did not bind me to a policy at that time.  


I have many more faults…. I often say what I am thinking… I tend to tease…. I can get upset when I feel I am unfairly challenged or targeted …. I use colloquial expressions that certainly have passed there time… I have experienced depression creeps into my life when things go wrong…. To this depression fault on Thu and Fri last week I was in a bad place with regards to continuing with Teaching.  It was many of the messages by you as students that helped me out of a dark spot.


However, even beyond your uplifting messages, I spent my weekend looking for guidance.  I spent time at the Temple, and listened to 10 hours of talks to reform and improve myself.  Through this process, I have realized this place, Del Norte HS, is a place that I can do good.  Even if some do not like me, or are not willing to bear with the differences of my classroom style, and feel it is their right to discredit this situation.  I have seen and feel that I am doing some good.  I apologize to those who feel uncomfortable in my class or in my presence.  I will do all I can to try to get administration and/or counseling to assist you with your burdens.  I encourage you to seek help outside the classroom as you have troubles.  Or, if I can gain your confidence, I will work with you on a deal that makes you reach your academic goals and strives minimizes your discomfort in your our clas situation.


I hope you can forgive me for my faults.  From here, my message is one of HOPE.   A HOPE that we can establish a positive and spirited momentum these last 7 weeks.  A momentum that is rooted on helping each other, meaning a whole lot of COLLABORATION.  A HOPE that we see this a a learning journey as opportunity to improve ourselves, improve each other, become thinkers and be doers, and understand in SO DOING that A's can be achieved.  I believe in each of you and your potential for GREATNESS.  Today and for the remainder of of this 7 week ride I HOPE to be looking forward, and I HOPE to see you out in front ENJOYING the ride.
