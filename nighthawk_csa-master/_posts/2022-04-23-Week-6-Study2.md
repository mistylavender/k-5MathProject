# 2022 Tri 3 Week 6: 4/25 - 5/2, AP Preparation Week 2.

### Practice Testing
This is the second of two weeks of AP Test Study.   Everyone will be performing AP Classroom MCQs and FRQs, even PBL coders.  Only exception is if I have observed actions in your PBL and provided you an exception.  Such exception is merited on Technical Challenge beyond CB or College/Career development.  


* Requirements for Testing
    * No collaboration, no outside sources during classroom testing.
    * MCQ testing.  50% score required on live session for points (1 or 0).  MCQ scores will be complete on CB site by end of period.  MCQ scores will be posted on GitHub Pages.  AP Testers will provide corrections, PBL Testers only need scores unless the score is under 50%.
    * FRQ testing.  50% score according on live session, evaluation is according to CB rules (1 or 0).  FRQs will be performed on paper.  FRQ papers will be turned in at the end of period (students need to take a photo).  Testers will post pictures of Quiz on GitHub Pages, everyone will have a REPL link on Indi GH Pages prior to live grading on Monday.


### Grading Adjustments
Review ticket should be provided by owner-coder with check boxes and clear tangibles showing completion. I have not been seeing this, yet the crossover-grader is giving extremely high marks.  For remainder of year, particularly as we move back to PBL project, owner-coder needs to provide clarity of tangibles in their review ticket.
* Adjustments
    * Crossover grading.  Collaboration and Peer review is a key part of Computer Science.  Grading has been very casual lately. If tangible work is not shown in review ticket, work should be considered incomplete and .5/1 should be maximum score.  In crossover grading session, grader has the option to suggest and update information with owner-coder during grading.  In the end of grading session, if crossover-grader provides 1/1 on work without tangibles they will max out at 4.5/5 on their own work.  
    * Attendance.  Absence, Sick, or Events.  These last couple of weeks many have been missing class.  I have asked, in the past, that you message me in Slack and discuss what you can do to make things up.  In PBL, as well as Test Prep, attendance is very important.  Also, if you don't participate in the events of class, like crossover-grading, you are missing out on an important learning experiences.
    * Teacher review.  From now on Teacher will reserve .5 after crossover evaluations.  Maximum crossover score will be 4.5/5.  Teacher will be looking at Tangbiles, Student completeness, and Grader evaluations for final .5.  


### Here is Friday Acting/Skit/Improv (ASI) activity - Extra credit grading and donuts will be up for grabs.
Northeastern University requires all of its computer science majors to take improv class ... The Wall Street Journal says it "forces students to come out of their shells and exercise creative play" before they can get their diplomas. ... "We saw a lot of hysterics and crying," says Carla E. Brodley, dean of the computer science department.).  

* Rules...
    1. Pick a subject that is related to Tech, Algorithm, Teaching, Study, Classroom or N@tM experience.
    2. Must be done in one or two Scrum Teams, anyone who does not participate will receive a 1 point deduction from Seed
    3. Objective is to make Teacher(s) laugh, cry, or be amazed. Make sure there is some CS educational basis to ASI activity.
