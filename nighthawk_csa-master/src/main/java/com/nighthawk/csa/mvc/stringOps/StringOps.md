# StringOps with Spring/Java/JavaScript

### Overview
This lab/challenge is intended to build on concepts from PBL and CB.  Items #1-#4 are intended to start as an in class challenge, individual and/or team points can be applied to the week score as credit or extrac credit.  This challenge will require using topics that "string" together concepts from the 1st half of the year.  If you don't 

# Pull code and analyze.  Get started on Activities for Credit/Extra Credit.  Work as a Team, think of design and work split before coding.
1.  **Hack** Find a user input sequence that causes an unhandled error condition (ie 500).  Trap and handle the error condition in logical manner, aka same as other errors.
1.  **Hack** Model method (with the managed String Sequence and a split delimiter return a List of Strings on each change).  Add a tester method and incorporate into "model" tester
1. **Hack** Controller add a "split" action (given the action "split" and a delimter "<space> or ," invoke model method to solve.  Activity, add a new "split" event, get it to work between "control" and "model" and incorporate into the "control" tester.
1. **Hack** Add FrontEnd code for "split" use case, this should be considered as a result that is updated like the String Sequence on each update.  Activity, add split delimiter as input (<space> or comma), perhaps you could smart calculate based off of input, consider placement and design of input and results so it seems logical.

# Further Study Options
To show resolute mindset, engineer could/should study topicss that add to their tool chest.  Enhancing or making complementary FRQ with technologies listed and shown in this code would help Team and Student receive higher scores.
  
### Control Topics
* Java Switch Statements
* RequestEntity, ResponseEntity
* Control tester (static methods)
### Model Topics
* Java String Methods
* Java List, ArrayList
* College Board CSA FRQ2
* Model tester (static methods)
### View Topics
* Thymeleaf work with Java Objects
* JavaScript API fetch, request and response

### Future PBL and Mini-lab Ideas
1. Build StringOps into your Scrum Team project and/or individual project, be sure to highlight a portion for the FRQ2 solutions.
1. Establish plan for Team or individuals to complete MVC solution each week, perhaps on rotation in Scrum Board.  Quality that was returned to Teacher on FRQ2 the first time needs to improve, particularly to be considered qulity ( A or B ).
1. String Ops could be used to build a messaging system between discrete systems, in a true *LightSequence GradShow* demonstration a series of commands or binary bits could be used to play the show.  In the case of an Inventors List, such a sequence could be used to look up and iterate through a series page updates and provide an *Inventors show*.  The inventors could be looked up through database records or APIs.  In either case, validation could be done on Adminstration screen, followed by a play action.
