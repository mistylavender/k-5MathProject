# Data Ops with Spring/Java

### Overview
This lab assists with PBL and CB.  The backend includes many College Board algorithms including usage of Statics and Sorts.  Beyond College Board the backend includes and implementation of Linked Lists which is a fundamental structure for any College CompSci class.


### CB Topics
* Static Variables [CB 5.7 V1](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/8/home?apd=2gde84qri5&unit=5), [V2](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/8/home?apd=2gde84qri5&unit=5)
* Inheritance Hierarchies [CB 9.5 V2](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/8/home?apd=wkp1dtdkz8&unit=9)
* Polymorphism [CB 9.6 V1](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/8/home?apd=pp1jhg3pvb&unit=9)
* Sorting [CB 10.2 Merge Sort V1](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/8/home?apd=14ybgme7em&unit=10), [V2](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/8/home?apd=yrqb7lfza1&unit=10)

### Mini-lab or PBL requirements
1. Build  section into your Scrum Team project or individual section for execution.
2. Build abstract Class and have multiple derivative classes (extend) with Override on method(s).
3. Have default data that loads and displays on Web page
4. Interact with data on Web to Filter result using Check Box and Radio Controls.  Add something unique like Animal noises.
5. Change my sort to merge sort algorithm as shown in CB in videos.


### Mini-lab or PBL-lab binary.  Make your own Data Ops/Class and initialize it. Point criteria follows...
* Use of toString(), Static, Sort
* Use of a Data Structure to hold Objects of your Class or Abstract class, better if it is a POJO.
* Web UI and visuals to interact with data
* Check Boxes, Radio Buttons
* Console testers of component parts of system.
